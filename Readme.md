# BdG spherical
A set of python tools to solve the BdG equations for a bosonic trapped gp. Example use is contained in the python notebook. The ground state used is contained in the "gs.g5" file and corresponds to a regime deep in the Thomas Fermi (TF) limit. Depends on several packages including seaborn, pandas and h5py.
